Since then an old fashioned web design has not been removed, an inaccurate and unspecific ethnicity estimate only marginally improved and a horrible family tree software basically unchanged. No wonder the size of their database has hardly grown, which limits the number of matches you get.

What a laugh this test turned out to be. Here’s what I learned from spending the $89 plus mailing and tax . . . . my mtDNA is of the J Haplogroup. THAT’S IT. That’s all I learned. BUT, I can find out more if I just upgrade for $159 to the Full Sequence. I should have bought the full sequence for $199, because IF I purchase the upgrade, I will have spent $248 – $49 more than IF I’d purchased the Full Sequence in the beginning. Thanks to the really helpful customer service (NOT). I’m not only disappointed, but I’m a tad angry.', 'Family Finder test was very useful since there are a lot of European matches. I think that it is very useful for finding Swedish and Finnish matches, there are some Russian matches as well. Overall FamilyTreeDNA has been more useful for finding these matches than Ancestry, 23andme or MyHeritage. FamilyTreeDNA has an unique database with tests of Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA. Searching or confirming male line relatives with Y-67 is really useful and there are many project for Y chromosome that one can participate. I’ve done Y-111 and I think it is to pricely and doesn’t give that much in terms of finding new matches and is absolutely unnecerrily if one just confirms a male line relative. If someone wants to go further after Y-67, than it is better to consider BigY-700 at FamilyTreeDNA or Whole Genome Sequencing WGS at some other company. Any serious genetic genealogist will end up with testing at FamilyTreeDNA because it is only them who offers Y-DNA and mitochndrial DNA tests. I would give 5 stars if FamilyTreeDNA wouldn’t so willingly give free access to entire DNA database for law enforcement agencies and would cooperate in updating mtTree. I know that FamilyTreeDNA has updated', \"Family Tree know what they're doing and it shows that they've been operating for years and years, I got the Family Finder, it was on absolutely on point and in line with my parents understanding of their backgrounds.

A weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\", 'Last year we purchased the $169.00 kit for my elderly and sick mother. We submitted the sample and were lead to expect results 6-7 weeks later. After 3-4 months we contacted Family Tree and were told that they had lost her sample and sent us a new kit. Mind you, had we not called, they would have not contacted us. We sent in the second sample in July/August 2017. In January 2018, we again called because we had not recieved the results of the second sample, only to be informed that they had an equipment malfunction and asked if we wanted an new kit to provide a 3rd sample or did we prefer a credit for the payment. We opted for the refund. Regrettably, my mother died soon after and we did not get the DNA information we had so wanted for so long. We wasted a lot of time with Family Tree because each time they did not provide us with feedback unless we called are months of submitting samples. Very disappointed. Very annoyed.', 'Not user-friendly, poor customer service, and limited results. I purchased this kit from their website to give as a gift to an elderly relative. I was disappointed by the lack of information provided in the results. Access to this information is web-based only. When I called to ask if they could send a hard copy of some of the results to my elderly relative who does not have internet access they refused. The only solution is to have someone take screenshots and print and send them. I have used other companies for the same price and received a hard copy in booklet form, more complete ancestry information and health information. Shop around this is definitely NOT the best deal. If I could do it over I would buy a different kit.', 'Family Tree DNA’s service is superb from start to finish. I received my results much quicker than the estimate given and I really like that I can download my raw genetic data. Warning, the results take time to understand, but I found several cousins I didn’t know even existed until my Father confirmed it! I also found out my maternal and paternal migration routes from Africa which was a real eye-opener. Overall I think it’s worth the price, I’ve recommended testing to all my friends and family!', 'My batch test were supposed to be run between 7/4-7/18. On 7/5 they delayed it to 7/18-8/1. Today July 18th they delayed it again until 8/1-8/15 with the same wording that it is an estimate and may be delayed further. I spent $300 for this frustration. When I contacted them after the first delay they said there was a “quality control” issue but it would be taken care of and given the highest priority – obviously a lie. Do not waste your money unless you don’t mind waiting for at least 3 months or more for results. If the tests are started the next time I will start a complaint with my credit card company and the BBB. Buyer beware. Also, as other people have pointed out the website is the poster child for being user unfriendly. Michael P', 'Explained to customer service that my Very elderly and ill Mother has no saliva and could that affect the results. They stated that if there was a problem then the DNA would not be able to be tested. The results were clearly way way off – Bogus – My mothers family, myself and siblings tested with about 40% Portuguese and She came up with none along with other ethnicities we do not contain. Contacted them and they argued that it is correct. No Resolution. Clearly highly inaccurate in this case. Will complain to other sources.', 'Reports are a bit clunky compared to 23andme but it’s the phone support that FTDNA provide that’s inspired me to write this review I’ve called them 3 times about my paternal lineage, paternal haplogroup and family finder results.

I found the results were geared more to finding family than actually learning about my personal ancestry – I was expecting FTDNA to turn my DNA into a ready made family tree but the reports are a bit more ‘hands on’ than that. That said, going through my list of distant relatives and seeing the names of the ancestors I share with them is mind boggling – sometimes you even see where that ancestor lived and how long ago they were born! I’d say these tests are expensive but there are so many tools to play with that I can understand the price.', 'A lot more detailed than I realised.

My mother-in-law had the National Geographic GENO 2.0 and FamilyTreeDNA mtFull Sequence. The original tests showed similar results. However, a couple years later, FamilyTreeDNA did a re-evaluation or something which changed her origins. My parent also shifted a little, but nothing relevant. My mother-in-law’s new results stated she had DNA from the western hemisphere (South/Central America). I feel this is in error since my mother-in-law is from central Russia with no known relative ever coming to the western hemisphere. The original test as well as GENO 2.0 stated Eastern Europe, south, central and west Asia. From what I have heard/read, the original migrants to the Western Hemisphere did not migrate back to Asia, so this would tell me South/Central DNA could not have migrated back to my mother-in-law’s genome.', 'I received my mtDNA Full Sequence and YDNA67 results on Tuesday. I had a quite a few questions when I logged in to see my genetic genealogy – this is a complex platform, not for the faint-hearted!! I tried using their knowledgebase, hunting around for answers and scan-reading dozens of forum entries, but tired of this pretty quickly. I got through to FamilyTreeDNA on the phone and they went out of their way to answer my questions and I wanted to thank them publicly for this.']",

Great organization and I would recommend them.', 'So much fun to go through with the kids', 'Interesting to go through the process but the results suggest a much higher % of lab than I believe… Am shopping around for another test', 'Great service, and the result was very good explained! I found the result of the test very trustfull. I really understand my dog’s behaver much better now.', 'He knows I adore my terrier (AJ) so I was delighted when he got me this DNA test as a gift. It’s been years since I’ve tried to work out AJ’s breed mix but the results are in and my questions have been answered! Easy and apparently painless process. Thanks ‘DNA My Dog’ team', \"Our dog Sam was a rescue and we decided to test his heritage and found he has a mix of many hound breeds. Given this information his legs are clearly shorter than they should be and he has longer ears than the most predominant hound breed he's composed of (Basset Hound) so there's clearly more in Sam's mix than we can see. A fascinating test that has been well worth it - Sam is our mystery dog who's more than meets the eye!\", 'My little girl was delighted to receive this pack for her Spaniel and it’s cultivated an (already special) interest in her pet Excellent']",
