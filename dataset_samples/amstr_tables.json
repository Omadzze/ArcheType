Is.--(Speciak )--- Akron, ohio, will next Saturday hear the first speech deiiverd by Secretary Taft in the Ohio campaign.\n\n What policy he will enunciate upon the railway tariff question, especially since the rather sensational divergence of Senator Foraker from President Roosevelts policy Is a subject here of quite interested speculation. Foraker it will be recalled, made as direct issue as possible with the Preident on the regulation of freight rates and on all other railway charges.\n\n As Secretary Taft Is regarded as the strongest of the Presidents packers on the question and as both he and Senator Foraker are considered presidential timber for the season of 1908. there Is much guessing also as to how far the difference between the two Buckeye statesmen will affect the result of the election as well as the attempted leg islation at the coming session of Con gress\n\n It is believed by those who know him best that Secretary Taft will speak out no less boldly than did Senator Foraker, and that his speech will tend more than any thing yet has done to reveal the fact that there is serious division among the Republicans everywhere on the railway rate question.\n\n The Democrats of Ohio, viewing the evidence of dissension among the Re- publicans and being united on the ques- ton. are cheerfully complaisant, assur- ed that they will be the gathers.
